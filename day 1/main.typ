= Day 1: Introduction to Robots and Robotics
Today was the first day of Technomorph, an interactive 8-day program organized by Robotics Club IOEPC. Day-1 was not as intresting as it sounded like, just plain lectures. Our instructor in first session was Mr. Binam Shrestha, a young robotics enthusiast and Founder and CEO of Utthan Robotics Lab. He is in his own journey of starting a business in this field, and he shared some tips and knowledge from his own experience.

== Learning
The first session was about robots and robotics. We got a thorough understanding of robots and some glimplse as well. At around end of session, we also got a recap of version control and collaboration platform including git and github. Some highlights of our learning are listed as follows:
- Definition and origin of robot
- Types of robots
- Current trends in robotics
- Application of robots and robotics in different fields
- Version control and collaboration
  - git and github
- documentation platforms
  - Latex
  - Typst

= Day 2: Introduction to microcontroller and sensors
Today was the second day of Technomorph, and we had a session on microcontrollers and sensors. The session was conducted by differnt instructors, each for different topics. There was a small delay in starting the session due to electricity outage, but after the issue was solved the session went smoothly. We were divided into groups of 5 with me being in RC-Oscar. 

== Learning
The session was about microcontrollers and sensors. We got a thorough understanding of microcontrollers and sensors, and how they are used in robotics. Some highlights of our learning are listed as follows:
- Introduction to microcontrollers along with their examplse and use cases.
- Showcase of different types of sensors along with their use cases. Some of them are:
  - Ultrasonic sensor
  - IR sensor
  - Gas sensor
  - Lidar sensor
  - neumonic sensor
  - color sensor
- Architecture of Arduino, its components and pins.
- Introduction to Tinkercad and its features.
